User YUI for file upload it's simple.

if you need to work on AWS SDK then use aws_sdk_.zip file and s3.zip file which uses this sdk a sample file upload in it.
you can find on google the sample code for aws_s3_upload/download/delete.

AWS_secret key is used in YUI files...config.php 
copy from there and use it.
